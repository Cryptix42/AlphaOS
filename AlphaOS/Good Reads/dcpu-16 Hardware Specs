Name: Generic Clock 
ID: 0x12d0b402
Version: 1

Interrupts do different things depending on contents of the A register:

A  BEHAVIOR

0  The B register is read, and the clock will tick 60/B times per second. If B is 0, the clock is turned off.

1  Store number of ticks elapsed since last call to 0 in C register

2  If register B is non-zero, turn on interrupts with message B. If B is zero, disable interrupts


When interrupts are enabled, the clock will trigger an interrupt whenever it
ticks.

A  Behavior:

0  Poll device. Sets B to the current state (see below) and C to the last error
   since the last device poll.
        States:
   	0x0000 STATE_NO_MEDIA   There's no floppy in the drive.
	0x0001 STATE_READY      The drive is ready to accept commands.
	0x0002 STATE_READY_WP   Same as ready, except the floppy is write protected.
	0x0003 STATE_BUSY       The drive is busy either reading or writing a sector.
        Errors:
	0x0000 ERROR_NONE       There's been no error since the last poll.
	0x0001 ERROR_BUSY       Drive is busy performing an action
	0x0002 ERROR_NO_MEDIA   Attempted to read or write with no floppy inserted.
	0x0003 ERROR_PROTECTED  Attempted to write to write protected floppy.
	0x0004 ERROR_EJECT      The floppy was removed while reading or writing.
	0x0005 ERROR_BAD_SECTOR The requested sector is broken, the data on it is lost.
	0xffff ERROR_BROKEN     There's been some major software or hardware problem, try turning off and turning on the device again.
   
1  Set interrupt. Enables interrupts and sets the message to X if X is anything
   other than 0, disables interrupts if X is 0. When interrupts are enabled,
   the M35FD will trigger an interrupt on the DCPU-16 whenever the state or
   error message changes.

2  Read sector. Reads sector X to DCPU ram starting at Y.
   Sets B to 1 if reading is possible and has been started, anything else if it
   fails. Reading is only possible if the state is STATE_READY or
   STATE_READY_WP.
   Protects against partial reads.
   
3  Write sector. Writes sector X from DCPU ram starting at Y.
   Sets B to 1 if writing is possible and has been started, anything else if it
   fails. Writing is only possible if the state is STATE_READY.
   Protects against partial writes.

Name: LEM1802 - Low Energy Monitor
ID: 0x7349f615
version: 0x1802
Manufacturer: 0x1c6c8b36 (NYA_ELEKTRISKA)
Description:
    The LEM1802 is a 128x96 pixel color display compatible with the DCPU-16.
    The display is made up of 32x12 16 bit cells. Each cell displays one
    monochrome 4x8 pixel character out of 128 available. Each cell has its own
    foreground and background color out of a palette of 16 colors.

A  Behavior

0: MEM_MAP_SCREEN
       Reads the B register, and maps the video ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of video ram.
       If B is 0, the screen is disconnected.
       When the screen goes from 0 to any other value, the the LEM1802 takes
       about one second to start up. Other interrupts sent during this time
       are still processed.
1: MEM_MAP_FONT
       Reads the B register, and maps the font ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of font ram.
       If B is 0, the default font is used instead.
2: MEM_MAP_PALETTE
       Reads the B register, and maps the palette ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of palette ram.
       If B is 0, the default palette is used instead.
3: SET_BORDER_COLOR
       Reads the B register, and sets the border color to palette index B&0xF
4: MEM_DUMP_FONT
       Reads the B register, and writes the default font data to DCPU-16 ram
       starting at address B.
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 256 cycles
5: MEM_DUMP_PALETTE
       Reads the B register, and writes the default palette data to DCPU-16
       ram starting at address B.       
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 16 cycles

ID: 0x40e41d9d
version: 0x005e
Manufacturer: 0x1c6c8b36 (NYA_ELEKTRISKA)

A  Behavior

0: GET_STATUS
       Sets the C register to 1 if the SPC2000 is ready to trigger. If it's not,
       the B register is set to one of the following values:
          0x0000: ######################## - EVACUATE VESSEL IMMEDIATELY
          0x0001: Not in a vacuum
          0x0002: Not enough fuel
          0x0003: Inhomogeneous gravitational field
          0x0004: Too much angular momentum
          0x0005: One or more cell doors are open
          0x0006: Mechanical error
          0xffff: Unknown error - EVACUATE VESSEL IMMEDIATELY
1: SET_UNIT_TO_SKIP
       Reads the B register, and reads a 64 bit number from memory address B
       in big endian, and sets the number of units to skip to that number.
2: TRIGGER_DEVICE
       Performs GET_STATUS, and if C is 1, triggers the SCP2000. The status can
       be read as the result of the GET_STATUS call.
3: SET_SKIP_UNIT
       Reads the B register, and sets the size of the unit to skip to one of:
           0x0000: Milliseconds
           0x0001: Minutes
           0x0002: Days

Manufactorer: 0x1eb37e91 (MACKAPAR)

A  Behavior:

0  Poll device. Sets B to the current state (see below) and C to the last error
   since the last device poll.
   States:
   0x0000 STATE_NO_DATA    No vertices queued up, device is in stand-by   
   0x0001 STATE_RUNNING    The device is projecting lines
   0x0002 STATE_TURNING    The device is projecting lines and turning
   Errors:
   0x0000 ERROR_NONE       There's been no error since the last poll.
   0xffff ERROR_BROKEN     There's been some major software or hardware problem, try turning off and turning on the device again.
   
1  Map region. Sets the memory map offset to X, and the total number of vertices
   to render to Y. See below for the encoding information.

2  Rotate device. Sets the target rotation for the device to X%360 degrees.
    .-----------------.
----! VERTEX ENCODING !---------------------------------------------------------
    '-----------------'
  
Each vertex occupies two words of information in the main DCPU RAM. The data is
encoded as (in LSB-0 format):
 First word: YYYYYYYYXXXXXXXX
Second word: 00000ICCZZZZZZZZ
Where XXXXXXXX is the X-coordinate of the vertex, YYYYYYYY is the Y-coordinate, 
ZZZZZZZZ is the Z-coordinate, CC is color, and I is intensity.
Z is deeper into the screen, if the device is placed face up on the ground, this
translates to "up" relative to the user.
Possible color values are 0: black, 1: red, 2: green, 3: blue.
If the intensity bit is set, the color is drawn as more intense.
The black color is meant to barely be visible at all, except for in very dim
environments, or if the intensity bit is set.

"If it ain't a HIT, it's a piece of..."

Name: HMD2043 - Harold Media Drive
ID: 0x74fa4cae 
version: 0x07c2
Manufacturer: 0x21544948 (HAROLD_IT)
Description:
The HMD2043 is the latest effort on the part of Harold Innovation
Technologies to futurise the computing landscape of tomorrow; today!
It is a high-quality disk drive made from the finest materials known to
man. It supports a vast panopoly of disk formats:

Interrupt behaviour:
The HMD2043 supports a number of HWI commands based on the value of the A register:

0x0000: QUERY_MEDIA_PRESENT
If a supported disk is present in the drive, this sets the B
register to 1. Otherwise, it sets the B register to 0.
Media should be tested with the 0xFFFF command before use.

0x0001: QUERY_MEDIA_PARAMETERS
Reads out the physical properties of the media. They are placed
into registers as follows:
B = Number of words per sector.
C = Number of sectors.
X = 1 if media is write-locked, 0 otherwise.

0x0002: QUERY_DEVICE_FLAGS
Returns the internal device flags in the B register. The meaning
of this field is defined in the UPDATE_DEVICE_FLAGS command.

0x0003: UPDATE_DEVICE_FLAGS
Sets the internal device flags to the value of the B register. The
available bit flags are, by bit number:
0: NON_BLOCKING - if set, all slow operations will be performed in
"non-blocking" mode; that is, the hardware command will return
control to the DCPU immediately and an interrupt will be issued
upon completion.
Note that other commands issued during a non-blocking operation
will silently fail.
Until the interrupt is raised, the device will NOT consider the
non-blocking operation "complete".
Before issuing a non-blocking command, be sure to set an
appropriate interrupt message with SET_INTERRUPT_MESSAGE.
1: MEDIA_STATUS_INTERRUPT - if set, the device will raise an
interrupt when the media status changes: new media is inserted
or current media ejected.
Before enabling media status interrupts, be sure to set an
appropriate interrupt message with SET_INTERRUPT_MESSAGE.
The default value is all bits set to zero.

0x0004: QUERY_INTERRUPT_TYPE
The device will indicate the type of interrupt that it last raised
by placing one of the following values into the B register:
0x0000: NONE - No interrupts have been raised yet.
0x0001: MEDIA_STATUS - Media status changed.
0x0002: READ_COMPLETE - Read operation completed.
0x0003: WRITE_COMPLETE - Write operation completed.
The value of the A register will be changed to the error status of
the event in question, not the error status of the
QUERY_INTERRUPT_TYPE command itself.

0x0005: SET_INTERRUPT_MESSAGE
Specifies the message the device should use for software interrupts.
Takes one parameter:
B = Interrupt number to use when interrupting the DCPU.
If the device raises an interrupt before the message is set, it will
default to using 0xFFFF.

0x0010: READ_SECTORS
Reads a contiguous range of sectors into memory. The parameters
are:
B = Initial sector to read.
C = Number of sectors to read.
X = Start of in-memory buffer to read into.
The length of time this command will take depends on the state of
the drive and the physical parameters of the media in use.
This operation may be performed in non-blocking mode.

0x0011: WRITE_SECTORS
Writes a contiguous range of sectors to disk. The parameters are:
B = Initial sector to write.
C = Number of sectors to write.
X = Start of in-memory buffer to read from.
The length of time this command will take depends on the state of
the drive and the physical parameters of the media in use.
This operation may be performed in non-blocking mode.

0xFFFF: QUERY_MEDIA_QUALITY
Determines the quality of the media inserted into the drive. It
places this value into the B register. It has the following values:
0x7FFF: Authentic HIT media.
0xFFFF: Media from other companies.
All commands replace the contents of the A register with a flag indicating
whether the command succeeded or failed. The following result codes are
defined:
0x0000: ERROR_NONE - The operation either completed or (for non-blocking
operations) begun successfully.
0x0001: ERROR_NO_MEDIA - Operation requires media to be present. In long
operations, this can occur if the media is ejected during the
operation.
0x0002: ERROR_INVALID_SECTOR - Attempted to read or write to an invalid
sector number.
0x0003: ERROR_PENDING - Attempted to perform a non-blocking operation
whilst a conflicting operation was already in progress: the most
recent operation has been aborted.
 
Performance:
Full-stroke: 200 ms
Spindle speed: 300 RPM, 5 Hz using Constant Angular Velocity
Maximum data transfer speed: 768 kbit/s, 48 kw/s
Head position on media insertion: innermost track
Head mode: full duplex [1]
Time to seek to sector =
floor( abs(target sector - current sector)
/ (disk sectors per track) )
* full stroke time / (disk tracks - 1)
Time to read/write a sector =
1 / (spindle speed * disk sectors per track)
Example times:
1.44 MB 3.5" Disk:
Time to seek to adjacent track = 2.5 ms
Time to read/write a sector = 11 ms
Time to read/write entire disk = 16 s
[1] The head is capable of reading/writing both sides of the disc at the
same time.
